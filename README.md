# Assessing Quadrotor Control System Resilience: Designing a Test-bench for Cyber Attack Analysis 
In this project, we designed a dedicated test-bench for quadrotors to analyze the impact of cyber-attacks on control algorithms. The proposed test platform features three-axis rotation (pitch, roll, yaw) and single-axis displacement capabilities (z-axis), providing four degrees of freedom.

## Key Features

- Four Degrees of Freedom: Three-axis rotation (pitch, roll, yaw) and single-axis displacement (z-axis).
Simulation and Testing: Allows for the comparison of response performances of different control algorithms under cyber-attacks.
- Control Algorithm Evaluation: Focuses on the performance of control techniques such as PID and PI against popular attack types (FDI, DoS, Ramp).

## Findings

- PID vs. PI Controllers: The PID controller performed better than the PI controller in various cyber-attack scenarios.
- Robust Control Development: The test bench facilitates the development of new control systems that are resilient to cyber-attacks.

## Educational and Research Applications

- Undergraduate Use: The test-bench will be used in the Control Systems Laboratory of the Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department at Karadeniz Technical University, allowing undergraduate students to visualize and implement theoretical concepts.
- Graduate and Doctoral Research: Graduate and doctoral students will utilize the test setups for thesis research in control engineering or cybersecurity.

## Conclusion

- The developed test-bench is a significant tool for both educational purposes and advanced research, contributing to the development of more robust and resilient control algorithms in the face of cyber-attacks.
