# autonomous_control_package
This is where the autonom control and the cyber-attacks are realized. Movement is simple to observe the effects of these attacks. Drone just rolls -15 and 15 degrees and tries to keep the pitch and yaw at 0.

There are 3 different cyber-attacks that are realized in this package accourding to their mathematical model:
1. DoS (Denial of Service) Attack:  When someone deliberately disrupts the drone's communication or control systems, making it unable to receive commands or carry out its tasks. 
2. FDI (False Data Injection) Attack: Involves inserting erroneous data into a system to manipulate its output or behavior.
3. RAMP (Ramping Attack): Scales the injected data over time to gradually alter the system's behavior and evade detection.
